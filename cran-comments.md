## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Made sure the function to get API results fails gracefully (i.e., only gives a message instead of an error or a warning), including all information possible, if the online resource is giving back a status other than 200.

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.
