# Re-submission to CRAN

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Additional comments
This is a re-submission to fix a bug that involved tests not being correctly skipped on CRAN, causing them to fail in some rare events.
This re-submission also contains a new functionality to the package.

Best regards,
