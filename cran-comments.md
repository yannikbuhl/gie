## Additional comments
This is a fresh version of the archived package 'giedata'.
First, the package now complies with CRAN policy on failing gracefully.
Second, the package now has vastly expanded functionalities.
Third, the package now has a streamlined API.

I have thoroughly tested the package on multiple platforms and R versions, and I believe it meets all CRAN repository guidelines. I welcome any feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Thank you for considering our package for inclusion in the CRAN repository.

Best regards,
Yannik Buhl
